% This directory contains octave/matlab scripts for manipulating files generated by SW4.
% Instructions can be obtained through the octave/amtlab command 'help'. For example, to get
% instructions for the function 'readimage' in the file 'readimage.m', typed 'help readimage' 
% at the octave/matlab prompt.
%
% The most important scripts are listed below. There are several additional scripts for
% filtering time series, evaluation semi-analytical solutions for Lamb's problem and the LOH 
% test cases, and comparing time series in different formats, etc.
%
% SW4 time functions
% fcnplot.m     Plot one of the pre-defined time functions
% ftfcnplot.m   Plot the spectrum of a pre-defined time function
%
% Image files (*.sw4img)
% imageinfo.m   Calculate good contour levels for plotting an image file + other header info
% plotimage.m   Make a countour plot of all component grid functions
% plotimagef.m  Make a *filled* countour plot of all component grid functions (works best in matlab)
% readimage.m   Read one component grid function from an image file
%
% Volimage files (*.3D.mode.sw4img)
% readimage3d.m Read one component grid function from a 3D volimage file
%
% Sac files (various extensions)
% readsac.m     Read one SAC time series file
% writesac.m    Write one SAC time series file
%
% USGS files (*.txt)
% plotusgs.m    Plot a 3-component time series on USGS format
% readusgs.m    Read all components from a USGS file
% writeusgs.m   Write a USGS file
