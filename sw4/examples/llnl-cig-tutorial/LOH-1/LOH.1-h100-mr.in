# This is an SW4 input file for problem LOH.1 from the

# Final report for lifelines project 1A01, Pacific Eartquake
# Engineering Center, 2001".

# First we set up a grid with a spacing h (=20,40,50)
# over a domain (X x Y x Z) 30000 x 30000 x 17000.
# It will run from time t=0 to t=9
#
# The material properties are given by the
# block commands. They describe a layer
# on top of a half-space in the z-direction
#
# The solution is recorded at different locations
# and saved in different sac-files  (in the LOH_1 directory)
#
# A single moment point source is used with 
# the time dependency being the Gaussian function
#
fileio path=LOH.1-h100-mr.out
grid h=100 x=30000 y=30000 z=17000 extrapolate=1
time t=9

# mesh refinement along the material jump (100*10 = 1000)
refinement zmax=1000

# first define the material properties everywhere (half-space)
block vp=6000 vs=3464 rho=2700 

# then define the slower material in the top layer (z < 1000 m)
block vp=4000 vs=2000 rho=2600 z2=1000

# Gaussian time function gives the velocities directly
# sigma=0.05 gives freq=1/sigma=20 (LOH.3)
# sigma=0.06 gives freq=1/sigma=16.6667 (LOH.1)
# t0 = 6*sigma = 0.36 avoids (most) startup transients and is
# consistent with the matlab script PlotAnalyticalLOH1.m
